Puppet external node classifier
===============================

Implementation of a external node classifier that stores
the node relations with the modules in a database that
can be modified directly with SQL, using the provided API
or with the shell.


Usage
-----

Basic usage to request the classes of a node:

   $ puppet-enc <node>

To configure the database with the shell, run:

   $ puppet-enc -s

The shell includes inline help.

Nodes, groups and classes are strings, nodes can also be
regular expressions.


Configuration
-------------

Puppet ENC is configured using a python module, you have
to specify it using the PUPPET_ENC_SETTINGS environment
variable, and the modules has to be included in the
PYTHONPATH.

The default configuration uses `:memory:` as sqlite
database, it is completely useless, but it works :)

Another system-wide configuration is included in
`/etc/puppet-enc` that stores everything in a database
in `/etc/puppet-enc/enc.db`. This configuration is the one
used by the `puppet-enc` script.

If you want to have several configurations in the same
server, you can set PUPPET_ENC_SETTINGS and PYTHONPATH
according to your profiles and invoke the modules
directly:

	$ python -m puppetenc.shell

or

	$ python -m puppetenc.enc <node>
